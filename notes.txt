Why mathutil Doesn't Have a main Function
================================================
Purpose: The mathutil package is designed solely to provide reusable functions for mathematical operations. It's intended to be imported and used by other programs or packages.

Modularity: By separating utility functions into a package (mathutil), you promote code modularity and reusability. Other programs or packages can import mathutil to perform mathematical operations without needing to redefine those operations.

No Entry Point: Since mathutil is not an executable program but rather a collection of functions, it does not require a main function. In Go, only executable programs (those with a main function) have an entry point.



Craete a Module:
================
PS C:\Users\AV******\Go practice_1107\mathutil>
PS C:\Users\AV*********\Go practice_1107\mathutil> go mod init github.com/shaileshyadav7771/mathutil
go: creating new go.mod: module github.com/shaileshyadav7771/mathutil
go: to add module requirements and sums:
        go mod tidy
